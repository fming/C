$ ps -ef

TTY: which terminal invoke it?
TIME: the time this process occupy for CPU until now.
CMD: the command line that start the process

styem processes
$ ps ax

PID is 1, it's a special system process to manage other processes

start new process:
1.system(after finish, will come back) 
$ make systemc


2. exec is a series of functions.  (never back)
$ gcc -o pexec exec.c
$ ./pexec

when ps is finished, we are not back to the application, so we don't printout "Done."


3. fork (async)
this seperate to two independant processes. 

4. sync between processes
